# [The Amazing JavaScript Race](http://www.nodejshouston.com)

## What is The Amazing JavaScript Race?

Open to any student interested in learning programming and javascript. The Amazing Javascript Race is an interactive javascript challenge. Small groups will join together to form AJR teams. At first each student will learn from various code challenges. Then every student will form teams of 3-4 to advance to the next Levels of AJR. We will keep everything fun, simple, and stress-free so that your group has a blast.

Working together, teams will explore places through a series of fun challenges. Tasks include solving javascript challenges, finding inscriptions on historic sites, and taking creative photos.

After completing each challenge, teams earn points and badges on the Leaderboard. The code snippet is part of the overall puzzle code for the future app. When all teams have successfully retrieve all the code snippets, the fun can begin. 

Points and Badges will be displayed on the Leaderboard, which can be earned by attending Houston Nodejs meetups/talks and by contributions to the many projects. The leaderboard will showcase the total points accumulated. 

## The Problem

In the 2014-2015 school year, HISD student population was 43% African American, 30% Hispanic, 22% Asian, 3% White, and 1% Other. 36% of students were female. Four in Five science, technology, engineering, and mathematics professionals choose their career in high school or earlier. 15% of computing workforce is Black or Latino.

## Vision

AJR will help students for a future career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by providing underserved students more access to unique, hands-on learning opportunities in STEM and by bringing coding to more schools across Houston.
